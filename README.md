# Todo Aspire App - An Unusual Todo App (In Progress)

Inspired by huge announcements around .NET ASPIRE, I dedicated a few hours to testing this new amazing cloud stack.

And Yes, Yes... 
ItÂ´s as impressive as it looks.

## Todo App Sample Application with Linked Accounts. 

The objective of this app is to share your tasks with someone. 

## Features

- [ ] Simple Authentication
- [ ] Request Link Accounts
- [ ] Approval Link Account
- [ ] Crud Todo
- [ ] Notify Linked User Changes


## Stack

- **.NET ASPIRE (The beautiful, the best, the way)** 
- Blazor Web App
- Minimal Web API
- Entity Framework Postgres Database
- Redis
- MongoDb

And much more will come soon. (Planning to create a MAUI APP as well)

I look forward to working with it
BTW, if you have any interesting project in which I can be a good fit for the team.
